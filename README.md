## about the software

chuck some `code` for the main project in like this;

```swift
var Fat = 10
print(Fat)
```
As far as releases go, excluding v0.0α and v0.2α, versions with highest last number are final releases
i.e. 0.2.(highest number for 0.2α releases) is a full release.
After each full release, the second number goes up one
